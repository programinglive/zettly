# Todo Application

A modern, full-stack todo list application built with Laravel 12, React, Inertia.js, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui. Create, manage, and track your todos with a beautiful and responsive interface.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todoapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install && npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   # Configure your database in .env file
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

## Usage

Visit the application in your browser and start managing your todos! The interface is intuitive - create new todos, mark them as complete, edit existing ones, and filter by status.

## Release workflow

- **Prerequisites**
  - Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`). Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` to the body for major bumps.
  - Ensure the test-suite passes before releasing.
- **Create a release**
  ```bash
  npm run release
  ```
  This command updates `CHANGELOG.md`, bumps the version in `package.json`/`package-lock.json`, and creates a Git tag.
- **Optional version override**
  ```bash
  npm run release -- --release-as minor
  ```
  Replace `minor` with `major` or `patch` to force a specific SemVer increment.
- **Publish**
  ```bash
  git push --follow-tags
  ```
  Create the GitHub/GitLab release after the push if your CI is not configured to do so automatically.

## Commit message policy

- **Install hooks**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  The `prepare` script runs automatically and installs Husky commit hooks.
- **Enforced format**
  - Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
  - Examples: `feat(todo): add priority filter`, `fix(api): validate payload`, `chore: update dependencies`.
- **Hook behavior**
  - Husky runs `commitlint` via `.husky/commit-msg`. Non-compliant messages are rejected, preventing the commit.
