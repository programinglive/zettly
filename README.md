# Todo Application

A modern, full-stack todo list application built with Laravel 12, React, Inertia.js, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui. Create, manage, and track your todos with a beautiful and responsive interface.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todoapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install && npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   # Configure your database in .env file
   php artisan migrate
   php artisan db:seed
   ```
   Running the seeders now creates todos that already have sample tags (Work, Personal, Important, Learning) attached, so the dashboard filters and tag-based features are immediately usable.

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

## Features

### Core Functionality
- ‚úÖ **Create & Manage Todos** - Add, edit, delete, and complete todos
- ‚úÖ **Priority System** - Set priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) with color-coded badges
- ‚úÖ **Smart Sorting** - Todos automatically sorted by priority and completion status
- ‚úÖ **Tag Management** - Organize todos with customizable colored tags
- ‚úÖ **Todo Linking** - Create relationships between related todos
- ‚úÖ **Attachments** - Upload images/documents, preview images, download files, and delete with a confirmation modal
- ‚úÖ **Rich Text Descriptions** - Compose todos with the Zettly Editor (TipTap). The app sanitizes all saved HTML, highlights code blocks with Highlight.js, and shows a concise plain-text preview on the overview cards to keep layouts tidy.
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Overview** - Quick stats and priority-based todo insights
- ‚úÖ **Notes Mode** - Capture lightweight notes without due dates or priorities alongside your actionable todos

### Priority System
The application includes a comprehensive 4-level priority system:
- üü¢ **Low** - Nice to have tasks
- üü° **Medium** - Standard tasks (default)
- üî¥ **High** - Important tasks
- üö® **Urgent** - Critical tasks requiring immediate attention

Todos are automatically sorted by priority on all pages, ensuring urgent and high-priority items are always visible first.

## Usage

Visit the application in your browser and start managing your todos! The interface is intuitive:

- Create new todos with priority levels and tags
- Switch to note mode when you just need to jot something down‚Äînotes never require a priority and stay separate from your actionable task list
- Link related todos together
- Upload attachments on the todo show page (image preview supported)
- All destructive actions (e.g., deleting todos, tags, attachments) use a reusable confirmation modal for consistency

## Zettly Editor debug logging

To inspect TipTap lifecycle and toolbar state during development, the app integrates `@programinglive/zettly-editor` debug logging with a local toggle (no API key, no remote forwarding):

```tsx
<ZettlyEditor
  value={data.description || ''}
  onChange={(value) => setData('description', value)}
  debug={debugEnabled}
  onDebugEvent={handleDebugEvent}
  onDebugToggle={setDebugEnabled}
  className="zettly-editor-wrapper"
  editorClassName="min-h-[240px]"
/>
```

- `debugEnabled` is a local React state controlled by the üêû toggle in the toolbar.
- `handleDebugEvent` logs structured events to the browser console only when debug is enabled.
- No `.env` keys are required for this flow.
- Styling overrides in `resources/css/app.css` remove the editor surface/footer borders so only the outer card border remains. Adjust those selectors if you change the wrapper layout.

## Gemini integration

- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` (and optional `GEMINI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`) are set before hitting the chat endpoint in `routes/web.php`.
- `GeminiTestController::chat()` now returns a `504` JSON response when the upstream request times out and logs the failure for later inspection.

## Release workflow

- **Prerequisites**
  - Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`). Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` to the body for major bumps.
  - Ensure the test-suite passes before releasing.
- **Create a release**
  ```bash
  npm run release
  ```
  Powered by `@programinglive/commiter`, this analyzes commits, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, bumps the version in `package.json`/`package-lock.json`, and creates a Git tag with emoji-friendly sections.
- **Override the version bump**
  ```bash
  npm run release:minor
  ```
  Use `release:patch` or `release:major` for other SemVer increments.
- **Publish**
  ```bash
  git push --follow-tags
  ```
  Create the GitHub/GitLab release after the push if your CI is not configured to do so automatically.

## Commit message policy

- **Install hooks**
  ```bash
  npx husky install
  ```
  Run this once after cloning to enable the Husky hooks configured by `@programinglive/commiter`.
- **Enforced format**
  - Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
  - Examples: `feat(todo): add priority filter`, `fix(api): validate payload`, `chore: update dependencies`.
- **Hook behavior**
  - Husky runs `commitlint` via `.husky/commit-msg`. Non-compliant messages are rejected, preventing the commit.
