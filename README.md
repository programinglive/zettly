## Features

### Core Functionality
- âœ… **Create & Manage Todos** - Add, edit, delete, and complete todos
- âœ… **Priority System** - Set priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) with color-coded badges
- âœ… **Smart Sorting** - Todos automatically sorted by priority and completion status
- âœ… **Tag Management** - Organize todos with customizable colored tags
- âœ… **Todo Linking** - Create relationships between related todos
- âœ… **Attachments** - Upload images/documents, preview images, download files, and delete with a confirmation modal
- âœ… **Dashboard Overview** - Quick stats and priority-based todo insights
- âœ… **Notes Mode** - Capture lightweight notes without due dates or priorities alongside your actionable todos

### Priority System
The application includes a comprehensive 4-level priority system:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low** - Nice to have tasks
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium** - Standard tasks (default)
- ðŸ”´ **High** - Important tasks
- ðŸš¨ **Urgent** - Critical tasks requiring immediate attention

Todos are automatically sorted by priority on all pages, ensuring urgent and high-priority items are always visible first.

## Usage

Visit the application in your browser and start managing your todos! The interface is intuitive:

- Create new todos with priority levels and tags
- Switch to note mode when you just need to jot something downâ€”notes never require a priority and stay separate from your actionable task list
- Link related todos together
- Upload attachments on the todo show page (image preview supported)
- All destructive actions (e.g., deleting todos, tags, attachments) use a reusable confirmation modal for consistency

## Release workflow

- **Prerequisites**
  - Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`). Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` to the body for major bumps.
  - Ensure the test-suite passes before releasing.
- **Create a release**
  ```bash
  npm run release
  ```
  This command updates `CHANGELOG.md`, bumps the version in `package.json`/`package-lock.json`, and creates a Git tag.
- **Optional version override**
  ```bash
  npm run release -- --release-as minor
  ```
  Replace `minor` with `major` or `patch` to force a specific SemVer increment.
- **Publish**
  ```bash
  git push --follow-tags
  ```
  Create the GitHub/GitLab release after the push if your CI is not configured to do so automatically.

## Commit message policy

- **Install hooks**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  The `prepare` script runs automatically and installs Husky commit hooks.
- **Enforced format**
  - Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
  - Examples: `feat(todo): add priority filter`, `fix(api): validate payload`, `chore: update dependencies`.
- **Hook behavior**
  - Husky runs `commitlint` via `.husky/commit-msg`. Non-compliant messages are rejected, preventing the commit.
