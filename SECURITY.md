# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain the latest `main` branch and release tags. Security fixes are backported on a best-effort basis. If you discover a vulnerability in an older release, please disclose it privately so we can coordinate a patch release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email the project maintainer Mahatma Mahardhika at [mahatma.mahardhika@programinglive.com](mailto:mahatma.mahardhika@programinglive.com) with the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
- Affected versions or commit hashes
- Any suggested remediation or mitigation strategies

You will receive confirmation within **48 hours**. We aim to provide an initial response and remediation plan within **5 business days**. Please do not publicly disclose the issue until we have released a fix.

## Preferred Languages

Please report vulnerabilities in English or Indonesian.

## Public Disclosure

Once a fix is available, we will coordinate a disclosure timeline with you and credit the reporter in the release notes unless anonymity is requested.

Thank you for helping keep Zettly and its community secure! 🙏
